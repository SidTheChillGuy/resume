### Hello everyone!
I am Siddhant Mahajan, a bachelors student in Computer Science Engineering with specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from VIT Bhopal University. I am 21 years old.

My primary tech stack concerns to python and machine learning. I am versed with libraries such as scikit learn, tensorflow and pandas. I am also aware of accelerators such as CUDA and RAPIDS. I am familiar with C++, Java and SQL.
I have made projects in machine learning such as Cancer detection in Brain using Computer Vision, or Lungs Disease Detection via Audio synthesis. Recently, I made DocuSummary, which is a RAG system that utilised generative LLMs locally on a system.
I am open to learning new technologies as they come. I like to get my hands dirty, experiment with some code as I go about learning it. I believe it helps me understand better.

Apart from technical qualifications, I also parttook in NSS unit at VIT Bhopal University, where I attended and actively participated in events such as Intrnational Women's Day awareness rally in neighbouring village and 10,000 trees plantation drive at Sehore.

Thankyou.
